  <h4> The Story in the Book </h4>
  <h5> Chapter 1 </h5>
  <p> Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now.On her desk, lying between the copies of <i> Nature </i>,<i> New Scientist </i>, and all 
      the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite> On the Road </cite>.It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and
      the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>
  <p> She had spent the last ten years in this room,sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better
      to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work,unraveling the secrets of the Ilama <abbreviation title="Deoxyribonucleic Acid">DNA</abbreviation>,to be an outstanding achievement,
      Molly <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.  </p>
